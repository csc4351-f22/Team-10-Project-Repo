For our team to get to a project that we will be comfortable inviting other people to use. It must have:
<br>Search feature- This allows the users to enter the keyword to videos they are searching for.
<br>Percentage sentiment feature â€“Before clicking on one of the videos, users will see a positive or negative percentage display of the analyzed comments based on toxic or happy keywords. This allows the user to identify videos with toxic comments and avoid them.
<br>User interface- YCSA will have a simple interface allowing users to avoid unnecessary features and have the same experience they had while in You tube app.
<br>Filter comments feature- After user clicks on a video to watch, users can filter comments based on what type of keyword they would like to remove from the comments.


If you have extra time, what stretch features will you implement?
<br>The most ambitious of the "stretch" goals we have discussed is making our web application into a 'plugin' that could be directly accessed anytime the Youtube website is open on a computer. As this is a particularly complex project, this is likely something that will be done only if a good amount of the group wishes to continue the project following the classes end. Another stretch goal would be to include - when the user simply clicks the search bar - potential search terms catered towards the user's usual searches (based on cookies, if they are a repeat user) or their Google account searches.
