1. What is the minimum viable product for your team’s project? What features need to be completed to have gotten to the essence of the app idea?
<br>The absolute minimum viable product for our team's Youtube Sentiment Analysis App would be a single page were the user can submit a hyperlink to a Youtube video. From here the site would retrieve the info from the Youtube API based on the link and return a page displaying a static list of comments with their sentiment score. 
To approach the 'essence' of the app as a satisfactory ‘product’, the Team indents to achieve the following additional features: 
<br>-Embedded video player for selected video above comments section. 
<br>-Direct Youtube video search by keyword/phrase instead of requiring the user to copy hyperlinks. 
<br>-Calculated overall sentiment rank for the video based on the aggregate of comment scores.  
-Navigation for related videos or some type of content feed system similar or directly pulled from the vanilla site. 
<br>-Filter options for comments and video search by sentiment score. 

1. What features or additional engineering work will it take to get you to a project you’d be comfortable inviting other people to use?
For our team to get to a project that we will be comfortable inviting other people to use. It must have:
<br>Search feature- This allows the users to enter the keyword to videos they are searching for.
<br>Percentage sentiment feature –Before clicking on one of the videos, users will see a positive or negative percentage display of the analyzed comments based on toxic or happy keywords. This allows the user to identify videos with toxic comments and avoid them.
<br>User interface- YCSA will have a simple interface allowing users to avoid unnecessary features and have the same experience they had while in You tube app.
<br>Filter comments feature- After user clicks on a video to watch, users can filter comments based on what type of keyword they would like to remove from the comments.


3. If you have extra time, what stretch features will you implement?
<br>The most ambitious of the "stretch" goals we have discussed is making our web application into a 'plugin' that could be directly accessed from the sidebar anytime the Youtube web application is open on a computer. As this is a particularly complex project, this is likely something that will be done only if a good amount of the group wishes to continue the project following the classes end. Another stretch goal would be to include - when the user simply clicks the search bar - potential search terms catered towards the user's usual searches (based on cookies, if they are a repeat user) or their Google account searches.

4. If we run out of time we will simplify or even leave out the widgets that filter the comments, making the widget into a button that filters comments automatically. we will leave out the reconfiguration of the youtube video and just focus on the comment filter. We will also leave out the feature where you can sign into your google account.
