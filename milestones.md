For our team to get to a project that we will be comfortable inviting other people to use. It must have:
-Search feature- This allows the users to enter the keyword to videos they are searching for.
-Percentage sentiment feature â€“Before clicking on one of the videos, users will see a positive or negative percentage display of the analyzed comments based on toxic or happy keywords. This allows the user to identify videos with toxic comments and avoid them.
-User interface- YCSA will have a simple interface allowing users to avoid unnecessary features and have the same experience they had while in You tube app.
-Filter comments feature- After user clicks on a video to watch, users can filter comments based on what type of keyword they would like to remove from the comments.
