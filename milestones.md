The absolute minimum viable product for our team's Youtube Sentiment Analysis App would be a single page were the user can submit a hyperlink to a Youtube video. From here the site would retrieve the info from the Youtube API based on the link and return a page displaying a static list of comments with their sentiment score. 
To approach the 'essence' of the app as a satisfactory ‘product’, the Team indents to achieve the following additional features: 
-Embedded video player for selected video above comments section. 
-Direct Youtube video search by keyword/phrase instead of requiring the user to copy hyperlinks. 
-Calculated overall sentiment rank for the video based on the aggregate of comment scores.  
-Navigation for related videos or some type of content feed system similar or directly pulled from the vanilla site. 
-Filter options for comments and video search by sentiment score.
