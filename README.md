This document provides an outline for a Software Requirements Specification (SRS). You can find a lot of slightly different proposed templates around the internet, as well as slightly different explanations of what each section means. I recommend following this link when in doubt.

Sections marked with a * are included in the interest of completeness, but don't necessarily translate well to the particular context of this stack. If you're struggling to find things to say in those sections, it's not your fault, and I won't be grading these carefully.

You will get full credit for completing the specs document in detail, however concisely, but if the spec is under 1000 words in length, there's a good chance you're missing something. I would expect a full spec to have about 1500 words on average.

You should use Markdown for your document. You can embed images using the tips here.
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose

Note: this refers to the purpose of this document, not the system you're building.

1.2 Intended Audience*

Note: this refers to the intended audience of this document, not the system you're building. You don't actually have project managers, so the audience might just be yourselves and the instructor.

1.3 Intended Use

Note: this refers to the intended use of this document, not the system you're building. Think about how this document will factor into your team's workflow as you develop the product. Will it inform the roadmap? Will you use it to measure success/completion of the project?

1.4 Scope

This is essentially a quick tl;dr of the product and the need for it. You should describe all major parts of the architecture, all types of users and their use cases, and how your offering is different from existing systems.
1.5 Definitions and Acronyms

2. Overall Description

2.1 User Needs

2.2 Assumptions and Dependencies

3. System Features and Requirements

3.1 Functional Requirements

3.2 External Interface Requirements

Use your design mocks for this section.
3.3 System Requirements*

These describe required conditions for your software to be able to run. These would typically be CPU/RAM requirements, like you see for some video games. For a web app, you may not have anything to say in this section, and that's fine - just call out if there are any special requirements or heavy loads your server may have to deal with.

3.4 Nonfunctional Requirements
